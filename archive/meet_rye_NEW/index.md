Programming languages are user interfaces, powerfull, composable, scriptable, and the users might be specific, but still user interfaces.

Programming is translating from computer domain to user / problem domain (or reverse). Rye works closer to the user / problem domain. 

Rye also tries to be good tool for describing the problem, not just defining steps to solution. When the problem is well declared, working and improving path to solution is easier.
